                <p>This disorienting canted camera angle meant to evoke tension is a film noir favourite. It was
                    pioneered by Robert Wiene in his 1920 horror film “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari” and was associated
                    with German Expressionism cinema. Because of a mistranslation its name misleadingly suggests that it
